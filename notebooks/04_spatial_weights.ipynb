    "\"Spatial weights\" are one way to represent graphs in geographic data science and spatial statistics. They are widely used constructs that represent geographic relationships between the observational units in a spatially referenced dataset. Implicitly, spatial weights connect objects in a geographic table to one another using the spatial relationships between them. By expressing the notion of geographical proximity or connectedness, spatial weights are the main mechanism through which the spatial relationships in geographical data is brought to bear in the subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial weights often express our knowledge about spatial relationships. \n",
    "For example, proximity and adjacency are common spatial questions: *What neighborhoods are you surrounded by? How many gas stations are within 5 miles of my stalled car?*\n",
    "These are spatial questions that target specific information about the spatial configuration of a specific target (\"a neighborhood,\" \"my stalled car\") and geographically connected relevant sites (\"adjacent neighborhoods\", \"nearby gas stations\"). For us to use this information in statistical analysis, it's often necessary to compute these relationships between all pairs of observations. This means that, for many applications in geographic data science, we are building a *topology*---a mathematical structure that expresses the connectivity between observations---that we can use to examine the data. Spatial weights matrices express this topology, letting us embed all of our observations in space together, rather than asking and answering single questions about features nearby a unit. "

An important thing to note is that geography has more than one dimension. When compared to common representations of relationships *in time* used in data science, using information about spatial relationships can be more complex: spatial relationships are bi-directional, while temporal relationships are unidirectional. Further complicating things, the ordering of the observations in the weights matrix is arbitrary. The first row is not first for a specific mathematical reason; it just happens to be the first entry in the input. Here we use the alphanumeric ordering of the unit identifiers to match a polygon with a row or column of the matrix, but any arbitrary rule could be followed and the weights matrix would look different.

At their core, they are a \"geo-graph,\" or a network defined by the geographical relationships between observations.

Since spatial weights are fundamental to how spatial relationships are represented in geographic data science, we will use them again and again throughout the book. "

    "1. Rook contiguity and Queen contiguity are two of three kinds of contiguity that are defined in terms of chess analogies. The third kind, *Bishop contiguity*, applies when two observations are considered connected when they share single vertices, but are considered *disconnected* if they share an edge. This means that observations that exhibit Queen contiguity are those that exhibit either Rook or Bishop contiguity. Using the Rook and Queen contiguity matrices we built for San Diego and the `Wsets.w_difference` function, are there any Bishop-contiguous observations in San Diego? \n",

    "    2. Which graph has more non-zero entries?\n",
    "    3. Why might this be the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Graphs are considered \"connected\" when you can construct a path from any observation to every other observation. A \"disconnected\" graph has at least one node where there is no path from it to every other node. And, a \"connected component\" is a part of the graph that is connected internally, but it is disconnected from another part of the graph. This is reported for every spatial weights object in its `w.n_components`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. How many components does the Queen Contiguity weights for San Diego have?\n",
    "    2. Using a K-nearest Neighbor Graph for San Diego tracts where $k=1$, how many connected components are there in this graph?\n",
    "    3. Increase $k$ by one until the `n_components` is 1. Make a plot of the relationship between $k$ and `n_components`. \n",
    "    4. What value of $k$ does `n_components` become 1?\n",
    "    5. How many non-zero links does this network have?\n",

    "6. The *Voronoi diagram* is a common method to construct polygons from a point dataset. A Voronoi diagram is built up from *Voronoi cells*, each of which contains the area that is closer to its source point than any other source point in the diagram. Further, the Queen contiguity graph for a *Voronoi diagram* obeys a number of useful properties, since it is the *Delaunay Triangulation* of a set of points. \n",

    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    2. Using the `weights.Voronoi` function, build the Voronoi weights for the Mexico states data.\n",
    "    3. Compare the connections in the Voronoi and Queen weights for the Mexico states data. Which form is more connected? \n",
    "    4. Make a plot of the Queen contiguity and Voronoi contiguity graphs to compare them visually, like we did with the block weights and Queen weights. How do the two graphs compare in terms of the length of their links and how they connect the Mexican states?\n",
    "    5. Using `weights.set_operations`, find any links that are in the Voronoi contiguity graph, but not in the Queen contiguity graph. Alternatively, find any links that are in the Queen contiguity graph, but not the Voronoi contiguity graph. \n",

    "7. Interoperability is important for the Python scientific stack. Thanks to standardization around the `numpy` array and the `scipy.sparse` array data structures, it is simple and computationally-easy to convert objects from one representation to another:\n",
    "    1. Using `w.to_networkx()`, convert the Mexico Regions Queen+Block weights matrix to a `networkx` graph. Compute the Eigenvector Centrality of that new object using `networkx.eigenvector_centrality`\n",
    "    2. Using `w.sparse`, compute the number of connected components in the Mexico Regions Block weights matrix using the `connected_components` function in `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. \n",
    "    3. Using `w.sparse`, compute the all-pairs shortest path matrix in the Mexico Queen weights matrix using the `shortest_path` function in `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. While every node in a $k$-nearest neighbor graph has five neighbors, there is a conceptual difference between *in-degree* and *out-degree* of nodes in a graph. The *out-degree* of a node is the number of outgoing links from a node; for a K-Nearest Neighbor graph, this is $k$ for every variable. The *in-degree* of a node in a graph is the number of *incoming* links to that node; for a K-Nearest Neighbor graph, this is the number of other observations that pick the target as their nearest neighbor. The *in-degree* of a node in the K-Nearest Neighbor graph can provide a measure of *hubbiness*, or how central a node is to other nodes. \n",
    "    1. Using the San Diego tracts data, build a $k=6$ nearest neighbor weight and call it `knn_6`. \n",
    "    2. Verify that the $k=6$ by taking the row sum over the weights matrix in `knn_6.sparse`.\n",
    "    3. Compute the in-degree of each observation by taking the *column sum* over the weights matrix in `knn_6.sparse`, and divide by 6, the out-degree for all observations. \n",
    "    4. Make a histogram of the in-degrees for the $k=6$ weights. How evenly-distributed is the distribution of in-degrees?\n",
    "    5. Make a new histogram of the in-degree standardized by the out-degree when $k=26$. Does hubbiness reduce when increasing the number of $k$-nearest neighbors?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Sometimes, graphs are not simple to construct. For the `san_diego_neighborhoods` dataset:\n",
    "    1. Build the Queen contiguity weights, and plot the graph on top of the neighborhoods themselves. How many connected components does this Queen contiguity graph have? \n",
    "    2. Build the K-Nearest Neighbor graph for the default, $k=2$. How many connected components does this K-Nearest Neighbor graph have? \n",
    "    3. What is the smallest $k$ that you can find for the K-Nearest Neighbor graph to be fully-connected?\n",
    "    4. In graph theory, a link whose *removal* will increase the number of connected components in a graph is called a *bridge*. In the fully-connected KNN graph with the smallest $k$, how many bridges are there between the north and south components? *(hint: use the plotting functionality)*\n",
    "    5. What are the next two values of $k$ required for there to be an *additional* bridge at that $k$?"
